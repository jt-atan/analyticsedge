Airlines would use revenue managment and optimization to price seats

It starts by selling cheap cheap seats to cover the operating costs of the flight, then

- Linear optimizatin is a way to optimize revenue, for example, when you break it out across hundreds of fights
or differing areas, for example.

Questions to ask for my business:
